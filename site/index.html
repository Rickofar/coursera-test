	<h1>Hello Coursera! It is a great Course</h1>
	<h3>I have been having difficulties in making changes remotely on my Github Repository</h3>
	<h3>Come to think of it, I think I will have to resort to Google for help because the
            tutorial isn't explicit enough</h3>
        <h3>Never mind the gibberish appearing at the top. I'm just seeing the github works.
           I have been able to set up my first repository and I can access it remotely and locally
           on my machine.</h3>
