  	<section id="aboutme">
  		<h1>About Me</h1>
  		<p>My name is Frederick Adarode. I am from Ughelli, Delta State, Nigeria. I had my West African Senior Secondary School Certificate in the year 2009. Before then, I have worked as a sales attendant at an electronic shop. Through this work experience, I learnt basic customer service especially in handling customer complaints being one of the major objectives for any successful business. I also worked as an office clerk. It was an entry level position where I handled reports consisting of sales, expenses, monthly business performances. One of my responsibilities is ensuring that reports are filed accordingly both in hard copies and retrievable soft copies. This position also exposed me to the different channels of communication within and outside an organization. After which I proceeded to study Mass Communication at the Delta State Polytechnic, Ogwashi-Uku where I obtained a National Diploma with a 2.75 CGPA. At completion of the program, I did a one year compulsory industrial training attaché program at a telecommunication network provider’s KYC office. This further exposed me to customer service duties. I was also an Intern at a metering station of the Nigerian Gas Company. I did these two programs concurrently. Between 2012 and 2014, I attended the Federal Polytechnic, Nekede to study Mass Communication where I obtained a Higher National Diploma with a 2.96 CGPA and later proceeded for the one year Nigeria’s National Youth Service in 2015. In 2017, my wife and I started family business where I am currently the retail sales manager. This position has exposed me to deal with balance sheet and profit and loss account. Since I started working in the business, it has become clearer how business world is operating, changing and adapting to create more paths to success is a feature that I can apply. Through this work experience, I want to contribute more into businesses and make it more successful. I am currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web Development and I hope to make the most of it.</p>
