  		<h1>About Me</h1>
  		<p>My name is Frederick Adarode. I am from Ughelli, Delta State, Nigeria. I had my West African Senior Secondary School Certificate in the year 2009. Before then, I have worked as a sales attendant at an electronic shop. Through this work experience, I learnt basic customer service especially in handling customer complaints being one of the major objectives for any successful business. I also worked as an office clerk. It was an entry level position where I handled reports consisting of sales, expenses, monthly business performances. One of my responsibilities is ensuring that reports are filed accordingly both in hard copies and retrievable soft copies. This position also exposed me to the different channels of communication within and outside an organization. After which I proceeded to study Mass Communication at the Delta State Polytechnic, Ogwashi-Uku where I obtained a National Diploma with a 2.75 CGPA. At completion of the program, I did a one year compulsory industrial training attaché program at a telecommunication network provider’s KYC office. This further exposed me to customer service duties. I was also an Intern at a metering station of the Nigerian Gas Company. I did these two programs concurrently. Between 2012 and 2014, I attended the Federal Polytechnic, Nekede to study Mass Communication where I obtained a Higher National Diploma with a 2.96 CGPA and later proceeded for the one year Nigeria’s National Youth Service in 2015. In 2017, my wife and I started family business where I am currently the retail sales manager. This position has exposed me to deal with balance sheet and profit and loss account. Since I started working in the business, it has become clearer how business world is operating, changing and adapting to create more paths to success is a feature that I can apply. Through this work experience, I want to contribute more into businesses and make it more successful. I would like to study International Business and Management (HONs) to build up my skills in research and presentation as well as develop my knowledge into the worldwide business environment. When I study International Business I can secure a role in Marketing, Consultancy, Human resource Services or further grow my family business. International focus is really vital in the business environment nowadays and I have chosen this course because I am able to speak English Language fluently. At university, I would like to study this course as I hope to gain more knowledge and information in International business and work in business organization at different capacity. My hobbies and interests are to spending my spare time with my family and friends. I like to spend my free time reading books and learning new things. I have knowledge in Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office and WordPress. I am currently learning Basic HTML (Web Development). I also like working for social on my free time such as a charity and voluntary programs. In 2002, I was part of a nonprofit organization project that carried out environment assessment on incessant waste disposal under the supervision of CIVITAS Nigeria and I was given an achievement award.After I have completed my International Business and Management course from university with first grade, which I am very determined to stay focus at, I will look for a job as Head of International Finance in Retail businesses. I am very focused and determined about my course. I am confident that I will be studying the course successfully and hope my application will be approved.</p>
